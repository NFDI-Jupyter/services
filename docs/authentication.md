# Jupyter4NFDI Login

Jupyter4NFDI relies on the **Helmholtz ID** system for user authentication.

This federated login provides a wide selection of identity providers (IdPs), allowing users to log in with institutional credentials or social IdPs, like GitHub, Google or ORCID.
> A complete list of connected organizations is available [here](https://hifis.net/doc/helmholtz-aai/list-of-connected-organisations/#edugain).

> Once [IAM4NFDI](https://base4nfdi.de/projects/iam4nfdi) is implemented, Jupyter4NFDI will switch to this as AAI solution.

## 1. Visit the Jupyter4NFDI Login Page
Go to [hub.nfdi-jupyter.de](https://hub.nfdi-jupyter.de) and click the **Sign In** button.

> The web pages displayed during your initial registration may differ from the screenshots in this documentation. The registration process is handled by Helmholtz ID or the connected identity providers, so updates may change the appearance of these pages.

## 2. Sign via Home IdP or Social IdP

Choose the Identity Provider (IdP) you would like to use. Use the search field to find your provider and login using the credentials of your provider.
> If you encounter an error message after this step, it means that your Identity Provider (IdP) has not provided the necessary attributes to the Helmholtz ID. In this case, reach out to your IdP to request that they address the issue. If they need further assistance, they can contact the Helmholtz ID administrators directly.
