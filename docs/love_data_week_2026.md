# Workshop of Jupyter4nfdi [Love Data Week 2026](https://forschungsdaten.info/fdm-im-deutschsprachigen-raum/love-data-week-2026/)
In this online workshop, we will demonstrate how to seamlessly integrate research data into a reproducible Jupyter environment.

Following a brief introduction to the project, there will be a live demo and a guided hands-on session where participants will work with external data, conduct analyses, and share their results in a FAIR manner.

This workshop is designed for **researchers**, **data stewards**, and **anyone interested** in sustainable and collaborative research data workflows.

**Prior knowledge** of Jupyter is helpful but **not required**.
