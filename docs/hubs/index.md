# Jupyter Services Overview


This site provides an overview of avaiable Jupyter Services for researchers in within Germany and within the NFDI. 

> Please be aware that we do not offer support or have detailed information about the JupyterHub or Binder services listed. Access to these services may be restricted, and their environments are tailored to specific use cases. **If you're unsure which JupyterHub to select, the [Jupyter4NFDI](details/jupyter4nfdi.md) instance serves as an excellent starting point**.

<!-- You can filter the Services with the facets on the right. -->
If **your** instance is missing, have a look at our [contribution page](template.md). If you are interessted in current statistics, have a look [here](stats.md).
