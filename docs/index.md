[Jupyter4NFDI](https://hub.nfdi-jupyter.de) is an interactive, browser-based platform designed to provide seamless access to multiple **cloud resources**. Whether you are working on large-scale simulations, machine learning models, or data analytics, Jupyter4NFDI gives you the flexibility to perform these tasks interactively through familiar Jupyter Notebooks. While in the current phase only a one system is available, we will increase the number of resource providers in the future.

> If you feel a feature is missing in Jupyter4NFDI, don't hesitate to reach out to us at `jupyter4nfdi at lists.nfdi.de`. We welcome your feedback to help expand the possibilities within Jupyter4NFDI.

## Exploring JupyterHub options within NFDI
[Jupyter4NFDI](https://hub.nfdi-jupyter.de) provides a central JupyterHub instance accessible to everyone within the NFDI. Additionally, various consortia and partners host their own JupyterHubs tailored to meet the specific needs of their users, resources, or environments. These dedicated JupyterHubs are often optimized for and restricted to particular user groups. You can explore the other available JupyterHubs [here](hubs/index.md).


## Why Use Jupyter4NFDI?

By using Jupyter4NFDI, you gain access to:

<h3> 1. <strong>Cloud Power in Your Browser</strong> </h3>
   Jupyter4NFDI connects you to cloud resources, offering scalable computing power for your workflows, including smaller data analysis tasks, web applications, and development environments.

<h3> 2. <strong>Easy-to-Use Interface</strong> </h3>
   The platform uses the popular **Jupyter Notebook** interface, making it easy for users of all skill levels to interact with powerful computational resources. You can run code, develop models, and perform analyses all from your web browser.

<h3> 3. <strong>Interactive Development</strong> </h3>
   Develop and test code interactively with instant feedback, enabling fast iteration of data science workflows, simulations, and machine learning models. 

<h3> 4. <strong>Use Custom Docker Images</strong> </h3>
   Jupyter4NFDI supports **custom Docker images**, meaning you can define and use your own computing environment. This flexibility allows you to pre-install specific dependencies, configure your environment exactly as needed, and run reproducible computational workflows across multiple sessions.

<h3> 5. <strong>GitHub-Based Environment with Binder</strong> </h3>
   Through **repo2docker** integration, Jupyter4NFDI allows you to use the **mybinder.org** infrastructure to build Docker images directly from your GitHub repositories. This feature enables you to turn a GitHub repo into a fully functional environment without manually building Docker images, making your code and environment highly portable and shareable.

<h3> 6. <strong>Access to Specialized Libraries and Tools</strong> </h3>
   Jupyter4NFDI provides pre-configured environments with libraries optimized for **cloud** use cases, including scientific computing and machine learning tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.
