# Real-Time-Collaboration (RTC)

Jupyter4NFDI makes it easy to collaborate live in your JupyterLab environment. With the **Real-Time Collaboration (RTC)** feature, multiple users can edit notebooks, run code, and explore data together — all in the same session.

## How it works

1. **Start your JupyterLab** as usual.
2. Go to the [Jupyter4NFDI website](https://hub.nfdi-jupyter.de/hub/home) and click on the **RTC button**.
3. Copy the generated link and share it with your collaborators.
4. They can use this link to join your running JupyterLab.


## Important notes

- Anyone with the link has **full access** to all files and notebooks in your JupyterLab session.
- When your session stops, all RTC shares are automatically revoked.

> ⚠️ **Be careful who you share the link with.** Only give access to trusted collaborators.
