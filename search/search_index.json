This process is performed to better protect both your credentials and the resources that you can access.     </p> <p>       In the first login step, you start with the usual entry of a good password. The service then confirms the correctness of the password entered. This does not, however, lead directly to the desired entrance - but to a further barrier.     </p> <p>       The second login step prevents unauthorized third parties from gaining access to your account just because they might have stolen your password. A quite common 2nd-factor is a One-Time Password (OTP) generated by a so-called OTP-App you install and initialize once on one of your personal devices. This OTP-app then provides (in our case every 30 seconds) a new one-time password that needs to be entered on the login page.     </p> Basic Principle <p>       These two factors for authentication combine the building blocks knowledge and possession in the login procedure.     </p> <ul> <li>Knowledge - The secret knowledge is the password you enter.</li> <li>Possession - With the one-time password you show that you are in possession of a certain device (e.g., your smartphone), because only the OTP-App, installed on that device, can generate it.</li> </ul> <p>Source: Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik</p> Algorithm <p>       The OTP-App can calculate personal one-time passwords completely autonomously from the outside world using a standardized and open algorithm for the generation of Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP).     </p> <p>       The TOTP algorithm was published in 2011 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6238. The TOTP algorithm is a hash function in which a secret code is hashed together with the current time.     </p> <p>       Behind the hash function is the HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm according to RFC 4226 - in simple terms nothing more than a standard that forms a hash in a certain way.     </p> <p>       The calculation includes both a \"secret initialization code\", that is known to both the server and the client, and the current time. The final one-time password is generated from these two inputs and is valid for a certain period of time (in our case for 30 seconds). The procedure can be implemented in such a way that slight differences in time between client and server are accepted.     </p> <p>       Hence, any one-time password is time-based, calculated locally, and always unique.     </p> <p>Two-factor authentication is not implemented by Jupyter4NFDI or JSC-Login. Instead, you need to enable it in JuDoor (if you are logging in with a JSC account) or through the Helmholtz ID. Below, we will outline the activation process for both services.</p>"},{"location":"2fa/#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<p>2-Factor Authentication (2FA) better protects both your user credentials and the resources that you can access.

You have the flexibility to add as many systems and Outposts to the architecture as needed.</p> <p>Check out the JupyterHub vanilla architecture for more information about the shown components.</p> One Remote System    <p>         A central JupyterHub initiates Jupyter servers on a remote Kubernetes cluster.          The JupyterHub Outpost listens on port          8080          for incoming requests and on port          22          for SSH tunnels, enabling the Jupyter servers (notebooks) to be accessible to the central JupyterHub.       </p> 1. Send Request <p>          The OutpostSpawner handles a user\u2019s request to launch a notebook server.                 Rather than starting the server itself, it gathers all the necessary details for initiating a single-user server. These typically include the          name,          environment, and          selected user options.          Additionally, optional data, such as certificates          or trust bundles (used for internal SSL),          is sent to the JupyterHub Outpost when required.        </p> 2. Spawner.start() <p>          The JupyterHub Outpost utilizes the configured          JupyterHub Spawner to launch the single-user server.                This process, typically managed directly by JupyterHub,          follows the same sequence of functions used during a standard startup, including          run_pre_spawn_hook,          move_certs, and          start.          Any events produced by _generate_progress()          are relayed back to JupyterHub, ensuring users receive all          critical updates without interruption.        </p> 3. Send service address <p>          JupyterHub requires the          service address          (typically a combination of IP and          port) to establish          SSH port forwarding.                This forwarding allows users to access          the remote single-user notebook server, even if it is operating within a restricted or isolated environment.        </p> 4. Port forwarding <p>          JupyterHub uses a random available local port (random_port)          to forward traffic for the single-user server to the JupyterHub Outpost.                 It employs          SSH multiplexing to minimize the number of connections.          In this setup, the JupyterHub Outpost must have access to the notebook server's          IP address (service_address)          and port (single-user_port).                  Simplified port forward command:       <pre>\n        <code>ssh -L 0.0.0.0:[random_port]:[service_address]:[single-user_port] jhuboutpost@[outpost-ip]</code>\n      </pre>         It is also possible to define a customized port forwarding function          (e.g., to delegate port-forwarding to an external pod, see external tunneling). Alternatively, you can          tunnel directly to the system where the notebook server is running          without routing through a JupyterHub Outpost, as described in delayed tunneling.        </p> 5. Create service <p>          At this step, the JupyterHub OutpostSpawner          will create a Kubernetes Service, enabling the Configurable HTTP Proxy to communicate with the single-user server via this service.                 In the default configuration, the Hub pod is the target of the Kubernetes service,          as it manages the SSH connections. Consequently, all traffic between the client and the single-user server is forwarded through the hub container.                   It is also possible to adjust the Kubernetes service selector          or to define a customized service creation function          (e.g., to delegate port-forwarding to an external pod).        </p> Remote + Local System    <p>       This architecture mirrors the one described in the previous section, with the key difference being the addition of a        local JupyterHub Outpost service running on the same        Kubernetes cluster as JupyterHub.        It highlights that, in the case of a local Outpost service, there is no need to enable SSH port-forwarding, as the        notebook servers will be directly accessible through        Kubernetes\u2019 internal DNS resolution.     </p> External Tunneling    <p>     In this scenario, an additional pod was created to manage the      port forwarding. This means the management of SSH tunnels      to single-user notebook servers is delegated from the JupyterHub pod      to the external port forwarding pod.   </p> <p>     With this setup, single-user servers remain reachable even if      JupyterHub itself is offline. Instead of tunneling through the      Hub pod, traffic between the client and the single-user server      travels through the port forwarding pod. The Kubernetes service      for the single-user server is then configured to target the port forwarding pod      rather than the Hub pod.   </p> Delayed Tunneling    <p>     In this scenario, an additional pod was created to manage the      port forwarding. This means the management of SSH tunnels      to single-user notebook servers is delegated from the JupyterHub pod      to the external port forwarding pod.   </p> <p>     With this setup, single-user servers remain reachable even if      JupyterHub itself is offline.

Markdown should be easy to write and above all easy to read. John Gruber developed the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz with the goal of enabling people to \"write in an easy to read and easy to write plain text format and possibly convert it to structurally correct XHTML (or HTML)\". However, one should not assume that \"Markdown\" is a substitute for HTML. HTML is a format for publishing, while Markdown is a format for reading. The syntax of markup is minimal and only applies to a tiny portion of HTML tags. The idea of Markdown is to make it easier to read, write and edit prose, without the intention of creating a syntax that only serves to quickly add HTML tags. Therefore, the formatting syntax of Markdown deals only with questions that can be expressed in plain text. For everything else, use HTML. You don't have to make any preamble or delimitation to indicate that you are switching from Markdown to HTML - you simply use the tags.</p> <p>The following examples start with some simple examples and then show some not so common tricks.

It makes use of the expert features described on page 22 (as of November 25th, 2020) of the training material available here. Please note, that setting up a containerized Jupyter server for the JupyterHub at JSC might introduce certain drawbacks to your Jupyter4NFDI experience. Specifically, you will be restricted to the software environment that is installed in your container environment only, which might introduce unwanted side-effects to your JupyterLab-based workflows on the JSC HPC systems. For example, usage of the SLURM batch scheduler commands is not possible, because the SLURM libraries are not visible from the container environment per default. Also, you won't be able to use the Lmod software environment modules provided by JSC. Please note, that if these kind of side-effects are not acceptable, you might rather use a containerized Jupyter kernel as described here. You could also setup your own non-containerized JupyterLab server.</p> <p>Please note, you can switch back to the default Jupyter4NFDI server environment anytime by deleting <code>$HOME/.jupyter/start_jupyter-jsc.sh</code> after login to the JSC systems via SSH.</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <ul> <li><code>container</code> group access for the JSC systems as described here in the docs</li> <li>Jupyter server environment in a Docker (or Singularity) container<ul> <li>install at least the python packages jupyterhub and jupyterlab.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Specify the filesystem location that stores the Singularity container image,</p> In\u00a0[1]: Copied! <pre>IMAGE_TARGET_DIR=/p/project/cesmtst/hoeflich1/jupyter-base-notebook\n</pre> IMAGE_TARGET_DIR=/p/project/cesmtst/hoeflich1/jupyter-base-notebook <p>Convert the example Jupyter base-notebook (that is available via Dockerhub) into a Singularity container image,</p> In\u00a0[2]: Copied! <pre>mkdir -p ${IMAGE_TARGET_DIR}\n</pre> mkdir -p ${IMAGE_TARGET_DIR} In\u00a0[3]: Copied! <pre>singularity pull --force ${IMAGE_TARGET_DIR}/jupyter-base-notebook.sif docker://jupyter/base-notebook &amp;&gt; singularity.log\n</pre> singularity pull --force ${IMAGE_TARGET_DIR}/jupyter-base-notebook.sif docker://jupyter/base-notebook &amp;&gt; singularity.log In\u00a0[4]: Copied! <pre>cat singularity.log | grep -v warn\n</pre> cat singularity.log | grep -v warn <pre>INFO:    Using cached SIF image\n</pre> <p>Check that the Singularity image is available,</p> In\u00a0[5]: Copied! <pre>ls -lah ${IMAGE_TARGET_DIR}\n</pre> ls -lah ${IMAGE_TARGET_DIR} <pre>total 177M\ndrwxr-sr-x 2 hoeflich1 cesmtst 4.0K Jan 19 18:50 .\ndrwxr-sr-x 5 hoeflich1 cesmtst 4.0K Jan 19 18:05 ..\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 hoeflich1 cesmtst 183M Jan 19 18:50 jupyter-base-notebook.sif\n</pre> <p>Now, manually (!) specify the Singularity image filesystem location in the <code>start_jupyter-jsc.sh</code> script and check that the specified path is correct,</p> In\u00a0[6]: Copied! <pre>cat start_jupyter-jsc.sh\n</pre> cat start_jupyter-jsc.sh <pre>#!/bin/bash\n\n# Author: Katharina H\u00f6flich\n# Repository: https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jupyter-jsc-notebooks\n\nSINGULARITY_IMAGE=/p/project/cesmtst/hoeflich1/jupyter-base-notebook/jupyter-base-notebook.sif\nJUPYTERJSC_USER_CMD=\"singularity exec ${SINGULARITY_IMAGE} jupyterhub-singleuser --config ${JUPYTER_LOG_DIR}/config.py\"\n</pre> <p>And copy the <code>start_jupyter-jsc_singularity.sh</code> script to the filesystem location expected by Jupyter4NFDI (Link to start_jupyter-jsc_singularity.sh)</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>cp start_jupyter-jsc_singulartiy.sh $HOME/.jupyter/start_jupyter-jsc.sh\n</pre> cp start_jupyter-jsc_singulartiy.sh $HOME/.jupyter/start_jupyter-jsc.sh <p>Finally, opening a new Jupyter session via the Jupyter4NFDI control panel should now load the containerized Jupyter server that was setup here.</p>"}]}
